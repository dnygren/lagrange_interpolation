# lagrange_interpolation
Lagragian interpolation and modifications to improve its performance.

This directory contains programs to test Lagrangian interpolation for the
0118MF RTD temperature sensor.

The modified Lagrange (Barycentric?) algorithm is faster than the standard
Lagrange version. See the BarycentricLagrange1.pdf file (obtained from
https://www.math.umd.edu/~petersd/666/BarycentricLagrange1.pdf) for more
information.
